But recently, I made the switch to **Podman** for my local development workflows.\n\n### Why?\n1.  **Daemonless**: No root daemon running in the background.\n2.  **Rootless**: Better security model by default.\n3.  **Kubernetes Friendly**: Generate K8s YAML directly from containers.\n\nIt hasn't been without its quirks, but the security benefits are worth it.",
