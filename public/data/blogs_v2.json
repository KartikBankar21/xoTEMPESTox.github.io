            "raw": "🚀 Deep Dive into Physical AI: NavDP, Diffusion Policies, and Custom Robots\nI’ve recently been diving deep into the world of Physical AI and Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. \n\nMy goal is simple: master the stack from the underlying research logic to the simulation environments to become a specialized engineer in the embodied AI space.\n\nOne project that recently caught my eye is NavDP (Navigation Diffusion Policy).\n\n🧠 The Technical Breakdown: How NavDP Actually Works NavDP isn't just a standard navigation stack; it is a unified framework designed for cross-embodiment navigation without needing real-robot training data. \nBased on the architecture, here is what makes it distinct:\n\nEmbodiment-Aware Planning: Unlike traditional policies that might overfit to a specific hardware, NavDP utilizes a data generation pipeline that distinguishes between \"accessible\" and \"prohibited\" areas based on the robot's physical dimensions (as seen in the generated cost maps).\n\nThe Diffusion-Critic Loop: The core magic happens in the Navigation Diffusion Policy. It uses a diffusion process to generate a distribution of potential trajectories.\n\nDual Supervision: The model is trained with both Action Supervision (to suggest paths) and Critic Supervision (to evaluate safety). This allows the system to generate a trajectory and then have the critic \"filter\" it, selecting the safest path that avoids obstacles while respecting the specific kinematics of the robot.\n\n🛠️ The Hands-on: Isaac Sim & The Lekiwi Swap To put this research to the test, I decided to go beyond the provided defaults. Instead of using the standard Dingo robot, I integrated the Lekiwi (a low-cost, 3-wheel holonomic base) into the NavDP framework within NVIDIA Isaac Sim.\n\nThe Challenge:\nAsset Integration: Swapping a robot forced me to dive into URDFs, sensor placement (RGB-D alignment), and rigid body physics.\n\nProof of Generalization: This was the ultimate test of the paper's claims. By applying the NavDP policy to a completely different kinematic chain (Lekiwi's omni-wheels vs. Dingo), I could verify the robustness of the \"Zero-Shot\" transfer capabilities.\n\n🎯 Final Thoughts & Credits Bridging the gap between reading a research paper and executing it in a simulator is where the real engineering growth happens.\n\nA huge shoutout to the team at Intern Labs (Shanghai AI Laboratory) for their incredible work on open-sourcing this research. Their \"Unified Navigation Data Generation Pipeline\" is a massive step forward for Sim-to-Real applications. Also, this workflow wouldn't be possible without the robust simulation tools provided by NVIDIA Omniverse.\n\n🔗 Check out the code and the paper here: https://lnkd.in/dJQjcyqj\n\n\nhashtag\n#PhysicalAI \nhashtag\n#Robotics \nhashtag\n#DeepLearning \nhashtag\n#IsaacSim \nhashtag\n#NVIDIAOmniverse \nhashtag\n#ComputerVision \nhashtag\n#VLA \nhashtag\n#DiffusionModels \nhashtag\n#SimToReal \nhashtag\n#InternLabs \nhashtag\n#TechLearning",

The project had been quiet for a while, with 30+ open issues piling up as TradingView’s codebase evolved. Over the past three weeks and 40+ hours , I’ve focused on bringing it back to life:\n\n ✅ Fixed 25+ issues, from broken UI components to major keybind refactors\n ✅ Migrated build scripts from Bash to Node.js for better cross-platform support\n ✅ Created 9 merged and 3 open PRs improving stability and functionality\nMost of the codebase runs on TypeScript, with some automation and packaging handled through JS. The next beta release will roll out these fixes soon and it feels great to see the bugs that annoyed me for months finally gone.\n\nHacktoberfest is often seen as a time to chase big-name repos like Node.js or LangChain, but contributing doesn’t have to mean scaling mountains. Sometimes it’s about supporting the smaller tools that quietly improve your workflow every day.\n\nIf you use it contribute to it.

For most people, that’s a roadblock. For me, it became a weekend project.\n\nInstead of relying on the ISP, I set up an ESP32-based Wake-on-LAN bot that connects with Telegram. Now, with a single /wol command, I can power on my PC remotely no static IP required.\n\nIt’s not a groundbreaking AI system (that’s where I spend most of my time), but it’s a neat reminder of what a little coding + hardware tinkering can achieve. Sometimes, solving problems isn’t about waiting for infrastructure to change it’s about engineering around it.\n\n🔹 GitHub Repo: https://lnkd.in/d2AzDupC\n\n🔹 Demo Video: https://lnkd.in/dhAQa2UV\n\nWould love to hear what’s the smallest project you’ve built that saved you from a big headache?\n\n\n\nhashtag\n#Engineering \nhashtag\n#AI \nhashtag\n#IoT \nhashtag\n#ESP32 \nhashtag\n#TelegramBot \nhashtag\n#WakeOnLAN \nhashtag\n#Coding \nhashtag\n#ProblemSolving \nhashtag\n#OpenSource \nhashtag\n#SideProject",

Fully customizable and secure, Enerzal seamlessly integrates with any system, whether deployed on local infrastructure or in the cloud—a solution with immense potential to scale and improve efficiency in diverse business environments. 🌍💼\n\nTo my amazing teammates, Ayush Rai and Aadil Rayeen — thank you ❤️ for your support, endless fun, and the incredible learning experience we shared.

His insights and feedback were instrumental in refining our solution, and his involvement alongside KPRIET ensured that the event ran smoothly from start to finish. ✅🎤\n\nWe also want to extend our gratitude to the organizing team — Ahamed Thaiyub A, Jeyasundar R, and Pranesh Rajeswaran — whose flawless handling of the event made it an unforgettable experience. 🙌 And a big thanks to Rahamate alam ansari for taking care of all our accommodation needs and going above and beyond ensuring we were comfortable throughout the event. 🛏️🤗.\n\nThis hackathon has been an incredible learning experience, both in terms of technical knowledge and personal growth.\n\n\n\nhashtag\n#GENAIHackathon2024 \nhashtag\n#InnovationPinnacle \nhashtag\n#Intelai \n\nhashtag\n#intel \nhashtag\n#intelsoftware \nhashtag\n#oneAPI \nhashtag\n#jeyasundar \nhashtag\n#ahamedthaiyub \nhashtag\n#praneshrajeswaran \nhashtag\n#HackathonSuccess 🏆 \nhashtag\n#IntelKPRIET 💻 \nhashtag\n#AI 🤖 \nhashtag\n#Teamwork 🤝 \nhashtag\n#BusinessChatbot 💼 \nhashtag\n#GenAI 🔍 \nhashtag\n#Innovation 💡 🌍\nhashtag\n#Networking 🌟 \nhashtag\n#FutureTech 🌐 \nhashtag\n#TCET 🎓",
